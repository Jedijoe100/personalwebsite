            <h2>About</h2>
            I am 21 years old and studying a Masters of Mathematical Science at the University of Canterbury (UC).
            My Thesis is in Abstract Algebra and is projected to be finished in September 2023 with the submission
            deadline in December 2023.
            I also currently work at Imagination Station as an After School Facilitator.

            I love mathematics and using computers to enable me to solve problems.
            I constantly seek to grow and improve, investing time in optimising my workflow and going the slightly
            harder way to gain a better understanding of what is actually going on.
            I am self-directed and spend most of my time at high school learning topics ahead of the class even to the
            point of learning subjects at a year level ahead.
            I enjoy playing music having learnt a number of instruments and have been in numerous music groups even
            being the leader and singing solos in one.
            I also volunteer at Grace Presbyterian Church and Navigators (Christian university club) with singing,
            setup, sound mixing and Bible study facilitating.

                <h2>Mathematics</h2>
                <p>
                    I have a BSc in Mathematics and Physics and am currently working on my Thesis for a Masters in
                    Mathematical Sciences (MMathSci).
                    My thesis is in abstract algebra, a branch of pure mathematics, which involves modifying a current
                    algorithm in c.
                    I have also done numerous computational papers and have solved many computational mathematics
                    problems on Project Euler.
                    Some of these computational papers include, optimisation, numerical analysis and methods in
                    mathematical modeling.
                </p>
                <h3>Project Euler</h3>
                <a href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> is a repository of computational mathematic
                problems.
                Each problem is designed so that a low-end computer could computer the problem in under a minute if one
                writes the code efficiently.
                I have solved 74 problems using python, although there were a couple of problems that I managed to solve
                using just theory.

                <h3>Thesis - Computing Random Units in Number rings</h3>
                A number ring is an algebraic structure.
                It consists of a set of numbers, two operators, addition and multiplication and has a number of axioms.
                For example, the integers \(\mathbb{Z}\) form a ring with addition and multiplication.
                A unit is an element in a number ring with a multiplicative inverse, i.e. there is are two elements \(a\)
                and \(a^{-1}\) in our number ring such that \(aa^{-1}=1\).
                For example, in the integers, the only units are \(\pm 1\) as \(2\) has the inverse \(1/2\) which is not an
                integer.
                Another example is the rational numbers \(\mathbb{Q}\), in the rational numbers every element is a unit
                (every element is of the form \(a/b\) and that has the inverse \(b/a\)).
                We can extend a number ring to include more elements by adding roots of irreducible polynomials over the
                ring (where irreducible means the polynomial cannot be split into smaller polynomials).
                For example, the polynomial \(f(x)=x^{2}+1\) is irreducible over the real numbers \(\mathbb{R}\) (the roots
                of the polynomial are \(\pm i\notin \mathbb{R}\)) so we can build the extension \(\mathbb{C} =
                \mathbb{R}/\langle{f(x)}\rangle = \mathbb{R}(i)\) which is a ring containing the roots of \(f(x)\) and
                \(\mathbb{R}\).
                From a number ring we can then construct the ring of integers which is a subring that contains all
                elements in our ring such that they have integer coefficients.
                <br>
                Thus, the aim for the project is to compute random units in the ring of integers for arbitrary fields.
                For a ring of integers we know how many units are required to generate the entire set of units.
                There is an algorithm that computes this entire set.
                This project aims to modify that algorithm to only find one or two units.
                The application of this project is to improve the performance in finding Brauer Manin obstructions on
                curves, basically informing whether there are rational solutions to an equation.

                <h3>TrailBlazer</h3>
                For one of my physics university papers, I was required to work on a project.
                The project that I ended up working on was Trailblazer.
                This is a website repository of astronomical images that contain satellite streaks in them.
                I worked on developing the gallery page to be able to display images from the database as well as
                developing a way to connect to another repository using an api.
                The project's GitHub repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/dirac-institute/trailblazer">here</a>
                and a demonstration website can be found <a href="https://trailblazer.dirac.dev/">here</a>

                <h3>This website</h3>
                This website is self-hosted and uses javascript for the backend.
                To access the main part go to the <a href="kentfamily.nz/login">signin page</a> (to access the website you will need to contain me at joe@kentfamily.nz).
                The main use for this website is for my own personal use.
                This website has a scripture memorisation program behind a signin system.
                It also has a function that uses api requests to get memes from reddit.
                <br>
                On the technical side, this website uses mySQL to store users, hashed passwords, preferences and data
                for the scripture memorisation program.
                The backend is written in Javascript using <code>node.js</code> with <code>express.js</code>.
                The front end uses bootstrap, HTML and CSS.

                <h3>Procedurally generated biome maps</h3>
                One project that I worked on in high school was a program that aimed for realism and was written in
                Javascript.
                The map was built from square tiles with the biome depending on three parameters, humidity, temperature
                and altitude.
                The humidity depended on the latitude and the see level of the planet.
                The Temperature depended on the latitude and the altitude.
                Both of these were varied using perlin noise.
                Finally, the Altitude was generated using perlin noise.
                More recently I have developed a python version that allows for easier modification of the biomes using
                a csv file for the types of biomes and using matrices for the calculations.

                <h3>Physics Simulation</h3>
                Early at university I became interested in simulating formation of stellar systems only using
                gravitational interactions.
                I would start with about 1000 objects with one object in the center with larger mass than all the other
                objects.
                They would all have an initial velocity (as otherwise they would all collapse into a single object).
                Then all I would do is simulate each frame checking for collisions and computing movement with the only
                force being gravity.

                Over the Years I have also enjoyed playing instruments and composing.
                These include learning the violin and how to sing well.
                Currently, I am teaching myself piano and accordian.
                As well as learning these instruments, I have performed in numerous music groups that can be seen in the
